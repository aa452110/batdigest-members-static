Some manufacturers market their bats as 'hybrid' even if they don't fulfill that strict definition. Older Rawlings VELOs, for example, make a composite end cap that is also the last two inches of the barrel. Those VELO's were marketed as "hybrid." But true hybrids have a composite handle and full alloy barrel. In advertising theory, a hybrid bat has the best of both worlds: the durability of alloy with the better feel and lighter swing weight of composite. <b class="book-term">Composite: </b>Composite bats are commonly known as carbon fiber. Fun fact, the "CF" in Demarini's very popular composite bat stands for carbon fiber. Composite material designs optimize light, stiff and durable properties and manipulate sweet spot size, swing weights, and barrel profiles. Often, most recommend composite bats as light swinging and big barrel bats with less durability than alloys. Composites typically cost more than alloy bats. <b class="book-term">Alloy</b>: An alloy bat is a mixture of metallic elements shaped into a bat. Most bat manufacturers often claim to have a 'proprietary alloy' -- their blend of metals that they claim optimizes performance and durability. These alloys might include iron and some small fraction (&lt; 1%) of magnesium or chromium (for example). Although there are exceptions to the rules, alloy bats are stiffer and more durable when compared to their composite peers. (Also known as metal, aluminum).<b class="book-term">Swing Weight Calculation:</b> You can calculate the swing weight, and we often do in our analysis. To do so, you need the bat's weight (mass), the distance between the knob and the balance point, as well as the bat's pendulum period. At the risk of being too technical, the MOI changes as you change the location of your pivot. For consistency, the industry uses 6-inches from the knob to report the swing weight. You can calculate the swing weight of your bat with our at-home <a href="https://www.batdigest.com/bat-size-chart/bat-swing-weight-calculator/">DIY calculator here</a>.</p>p><b class="book-term">ASA Standard: </b>The ASA standard is the certification that allows fastpitch softball bats for high school and little league play. The other fastpitch standard, USSSA, is more often for men's leagues.</p> <b class="book-term">BESR Standard:</b> The "Ball Exit Speed Ratio" is the now outlawed performance standard predating BBCOR for high school and NCAA bats. BESR bats are only allowed in places with no bat rules. The performance standard of these bats was one reason why the BBCOR standard was created.</p> <b class="book-term">USSSA Standard: </b>(Pronounced "U-Triple-S-A")Known as 1.15 or "U Trip," USSSA bats are the most popular youth baseball bat performance certification standard. USSSA is often thought of as the travel ball standard, despite several travel ball leagues that use USA bats and several rec associations that allow USSSA. USSSA certification limits performance under 1.15 BPF (bat performance factor) and a 2 ¾ barrel. All other things being equal, the bounce from USSSA bats can be higher (and most often are) than USA and BBCOR bats.</p> style="font-weight: 600;">Drop: </b>The drop refers to the numerical difference in a bat's length and its stated weight. For example, a bat that is 31-inches and has a stated weight of 21-ounces is said to be a "drop 10." Such a bat is frequently marked as "-10" or "minus 10." It might also be described as a 31/21 in a store or on the bat itself. Drops are regulated. BBCOR bats have a drop of 3. USSSA and USA bats can have a drop 5 through drop 14. Please see<b> Stated Weight, Scale Weight, </b>and <b>Swing Weight</b> for more discussion on drops<b>. </b>Fastpitch drops typically range from -8 to -13. If a -7 exists, let us know. Drops are helpful to begin to understand how heavy a bat might feel to the hitter swinging the bat.</p> <b class="book-term">Profile: </b>The profile of a bat is the two-dimensional shape of the barrel. It is sometimes referred to as plate coverage. In effect, it is the amount of space the barrel takes up. The barrel's max diameter is limited by the certification standards (see below) of 2 ¼ (fastpitch), 2 ⅝ (USA, BBCOR), and 2 ¾ (USSSA). But the length they can be at that maximum diameter is not governed. The bigger the profile, the more it resembles a boat oar.</p>p><b class="book-term">Two-Piece Bat:</b> A two-piece bat is a bat whose barrel and handle are created separately and then connected after production. Two-piece bats include the hybrid bat (discussed above), an alloy barrel and composite handle. A two-piece composite is made of a composite handle and barrel but manufactured separately and then combined. Technically, every two-piece bat is made of more than two pieces as the end cap is almost always separate from the barrel, as is the grip. But we don't refer to those bats as anything but "two-piece." We simply use it to differentiate it from one-piece bats.</p><b class="book-term">Hybrid: </b>A hybrid bat has an alloy barrel and a composite handle.

<div class="book-intro">
<p>Dear Reader,</p>

<p>The bat space can be confusing, but it doesn’t have to be. With just a little bit of the correct information, you can be an expert at fitting your hitter with the right bat and knowing exactly where to find it in the market.</p>

<p>Over the years, we have written 600+ articles, made hundreds of spreadsheets and tracked 10,000+ exit speeds. We’ve also spent countless hours in conversations, email and otherwise, with readers discussing the right bat. This guide takes what we have learned and boils it down to the fundamentals of finding the right bat.</p>

Bats are integral to how well players function on the offensive side of the ball. The right bat at the right time in the correct size at the right price might be <em>the</em>  essential equipment decision you make. Turning you into an expert at getting that bat into your player’s hands every time, then, is our goal.

<p>No strings attached.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and thanks to all the athletes who have helped test bats, the companies that have helped us acquire bats for testing, and of course, you who read Bat Digest.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Brian &amp; Jon</p>

<p>P.S. If a friend sent you his ID and PW, we would appreciate it if you buy your own copy and support us in updating this guide down the road. Your large latte costs more, and it can’t help your kid hit a cut fastball.</p>

    <h3>Saving (some of you) Time</h3>
<p>Is it possible that the right bat is the one that you’ve heard about the most? You can read this guide to help you dial in the perfect bat...</p>

<p>...or you can save yourself some time and buy the one that most people seem to be talking about.</p>

<p>If we’re honest, it’s likely going to work out to some level for your hitter either way. Bats with hype usually aren’t terrible. Are they as good as people are saying they are? We are confident the answer is no.</p>

<p>But, “Who cares if the bat is better if the kid believes it is?”</p>

<p>We don’t. More power to you.</p>

<p>If you were waiting for permission to buy the bat you’ve heard most about, count this as our blessing.</p>

<p>Consider this, too. The better your hitter is, the less the bat matters anyway. Great hitters can make any bat look and perform exceptionally. Mike Trout would make a ho-hum BBCOR bat look like The Holy Grail of sticks. So why spend considerable effort finding the best bat when it might not even matter?</p>

<p>You would not be the first, or last, to lay down all your scientific sense, reach deep into your pocket, and buy a bat, eyes wide shut.</p>

<p>It isn’t an unreasonable approach, and at worst, you saved yourself the next hour or so reading through this guide.</p>

    <h2>Reader Beware</h2>
<p>However, if you are like us, you may have suffered some sort of childhood trauma that makes you physically incapable of buying a bat almost <i>because </i>it is the most talked about.</p>

<i>“Everyone agrees this is the best bat? It must be a conspiracy!”</i></p>

<p>We are drawn inescapably to data-informed buying for a few reasons--beyond our childhood trauma. For one, gathering and analyzing information is interesting, if not, dare we say, fun. And as much as that second season of Ted Lasso is calling our names, what better way to spend some free time than by confirming, and maybe reconfirming, that a particular bat type and swing weight is what will give our hitters the best chance at success in a sport they love?</p>

<p>And secondly, we are just straight-up skeptical of the hype. Hype is subjective, so if we are after promotion, why not just make our own? Why can’t my make-believe be believed as much as your make-believe is believed?</p>

<p>2015 Voodoo, anyone?</p>

<p>If you’re only interested in reading this far into the bat guide, take this to the bank: Anyone can wipe down a bat with the tears of a wounded unicorn, rub field dirt on its barrel while repeatedly chanting, “if you build it, he will come” and then tell everyone they found the best bat.</p>

<p>But back here, in reality, buying through the <i>hypevine</i>, if you will--the one that stretches from social media and through every little league grandstand in America--isn’t a place where we can comfortably sit, let alone defend.</p>

<p>Will the route of reason take longer?</p>

<p>No doubt.</p>

<p>Will others understand your choice and rationale?</p>

<p>Probably not.</p>

<p>Is it possible you’ll end up with the bat people were hyping anyway?</p>

<p>Maybe.</p>

<p>But if the trail of logic, empirical data, and analysis is what you must also blaze, we say climb aboard this reality train, my friend. There are at least a few still onboard. The road is bumpy, but there are answers ahead.</p>

    <h3>Common Bat Terms</h3>
<p>It seems strange to start a book with what is a glossary. To make it even worse, the following terms are not categorized alphabetically but by topic. So, good luck finding your spot if you lose it or need to come back.</p>

<p>But, there is little industry governance (and by little, we mean none) on where and when specific bat terms are used. And we think the following 29 words and phrases, found dripping among the sites that talk bats, must be understood and agreed upon before we can progress toward our goal.</p>

    <p>Although you are welcome to read through this glossary word for word, it may make some sense to skip to chapter three and then refer back to this when you encounter these topics in the text.</p>

    <b class="book-term">Alloy</b> An alloy bat is a mixture of metallic elements shaped into a bat. Most bat manufacturers often claim to have a ‘proprietary alloy’ -- their blend of metals that they claim optimizes performance and durability. These alloys might include iron and some small fraction (&lt; 1%) of magnesium or chromium (for example). Although there are exceptions to the rules, alloy bats are stiffer and more durable when compared to their composite peers. (Also known as metal, aluminum).

    <b class="book-term">Composite</b> Composite bats are commonly known as carbon fiber. Fun fact, the “CF” in Demarini’s very popular composite bat stands for carbon fiber. Composite material designs optimize light, stiff and durable properties and manipulate sweet spot size, swing weights, and barrel profiles. Often, most recommend composite bats as light swinging and big barrel bats with less durability than alloys. Composites typically cost more than alloy bats.

    <b class="book-term">Hybrid</b> A hybrid bat has an alloy barrel and a composite handle. Some manufacturers market their bats as ‘hybrid’ even if they don’t fulfill that strict definition. Older Rawlings VELOs, for example, make a composite end cap that is also the last two inches of the barrel. Those VELO’s were marketed as “hybrid.” But true hybrids have a composite handle and full alloy barrel. In advertising theory, a hybrid bat has the best of both worlds: the durability of alloy with the better feel and lighter swing weight of composite.

    <b class="book-term">Wood Bats</b> Wood bats refer to a single piece of birch, maple, or ash lathed from a single billet. These wood bats are the type of bat the players in the MLB use. Other types of wood, like Bamboo, are also made into bats and sold. Generally, most wood bat types lack durability compared to alloy and composite bats, and although it is hard to prove, they tend to have a smaller sweet spot. However, according to many of us, they strike the chord of tradition and sound fantastic.</p>

    <b class="book-term">Wood Composite</b> Wood composite bats are crafted from a mix of wood parts and composite pieces. If a hybrid is composite and alloy, then a wood composite is composite and wood. Wood fragments or timber shavings are glued together around composite framing to form a bat. Wood composites are durable and popular in wood bat leagues. Some are sanctioned for the lower ranks of professional baseball. Many wood composite bats are BBCOR certified, and most are approved in wood bat tournaments.</p>

    <b class="book-term">Two-Piece Bat</b> A two-piece bat is a bat whose barrel and handle are created separately and then connected after production. Two-piece bats include the hybrid bat (discussed above), an alloy barrel and composite handle. A two-piece composite is made of a composite handle and barrel but manufactured separately and then combined. Technically, every two-piece bat is made of more than two pieces as the end cap is almost always separate from the barrel, as is the grip. But we don’t refer to those bats as anything but “two-piece.” We simply use it to differentiate it from one-piece bats.

    <b class="book-term">One-Piece Bat</b> Also known as single-piece bats, a one-piece bat has a barrel and handle created together in the same process. Like two-piece bats, one-piece bats are made of more than one piece, but the end cap, grip, etc., do not count as additional pieces. While most one-piece bats are alloy, a few single-piece composite bats are on the market. The only actual one-piece bats are wood bats, but for some reason, they are referred to only as wood bats, never as one-piece bats.</p>

    <b class="book-term">Profile</b> The profile of a bat is the two-dimensional shape of the barrel. It is sometimes referred to as plate coverage. In effect, it is the amount of space the barrel takes up. The barrel’s max diameter is limited by the certification standards (see below) of 2 ¼ (fastpitch), 2 ⅝ (USA, BBCOR), and 2 ¾ (USSSA). But the length they can be at that maximum diameter is not governed. The bigger the profile, the more it resembles a boat oar.

    <b class="book-term">Drop</b> The drop refers to the numerical difference in a bat’s length and its stated weight. For example, a bat that is 31-inches and has a stated weight of 21-ounces is said to be a “drop 10.” Such a bat is frequently marked as “-10” or “minus 10.” It might also be described as a 31/21 in a store or on the bat itself. Drops are regulated. BBCOR bats have a drop of 3. USSSA and USA bats can have a drop 5 through drop 14. Please see<b> Stated Weight, Scale Weight, </b>and <b>Swing Weight</b> for more discussion on drops<b>. </b>Fastpitch drops typically range from -8 to -13. If a -7 exists, let us know. Drops are helpful to begin to understand how heavy a bat might feel to the hitter swinging the bat.

    <b class="book-term">Bat Certification Standard</b> Performance standards are created for various reasons such as safety (i.e., keeping balls flying off bats at speeds less dangerous for kids); the integrity of the game (i.e., creating an even playing field between offense and defense); and fair play (i.e., using bats of a similar standard makes for an even playing field among teams in the same leagues). BBCOR, USA, USSSA, ASA, and BESR are bat certification standards.</p>

    <b class="book-term">BBCOR Standard</b> BBCOR (Batted Ball Coefficient of Restitution) is a certification that regulates bat performance for high school, middle school, and other baseball leagues. Measured with sensitive equipment, the standard restricts the performance (.50 BBCOR), barrel diameter (2 ⅝), and drop (3) of its bats. BBCOR limits performance in a way intended to recreate the maximum pop of a wood bat. Very few bat manufacturers, and none of the big ones, share their BBCOR performance data with the public. BBCOR came into effect around 2012.</p>

    <b class="book-term">USA Standard</b> The USA standard governs the performance of some youth baseball bats. Like BBCOR, this standard limits the trampoline effect of alloy and composite barrels to wood bat performance. It also limits barrel diameter to no greater than 2 ⅝-inch. Unlike BBCOR, USA Bats permit any number drop. Although not as popular as USSSA youth baseball bats, USA bats are generally considered the standard for Little League and are most prominently featured by the Little League World Series. Other nationwide leagues like Cal Ripken require USA Bats as well. The USA standard came into effect in 2018.</p>

    <b class="book-term">USSSA Standard</b> (Pronounced “U-Triple-S-A”)Known as 1.15 or “U Trip,” USSSA bats are the most popular youth baseball bat performance certification standard. USSSA is often thought of as the travel ball standard, despite several travel ball leagues that use USA bats and several rec associations that allow USSSA. USSSA certification limits performance under 1.15 BPF (bat performance factor) and a 2 ¾ barrel. All other things being equal, the bounce from USSSA bats can be higher (and most often are) than USA and BBCOR bats.

    <b class="book-term">BESR Standard</b> The “Ball Exit Speed Ratio” is the now outlawed performance standard predating BBCOR for high school and NCAA bats. BESR bats are only allowed in places with no bat rules. The performance standard of these bats was one reason why the BBCOR standard was created.

    <b class="book-term">ASA Standard</b> The ASA standard is the certification that allows fastpitch softball bats for high school and little league play. The other fastpitch standard, USSSA, is more often for men’s leagues.

    <b class="book-term">Swing Weight</b> Swing weight, sometimes called ‘mass moment of inertia’ or MOI, is a technical measurement describing the force required to move an object around a pivot. It is an essential data point representing how difficult it is to swing a bat. The higher the value determined by the swing weight calculation equation, the heavier (harder to swing or more strength needed to swing) the bat is. Since different hitters have different swing types and the location of their pivots will vary, swing weight becomes a somewhat comparable property based on the player’s mechanics. This is one reason why two bats can feel like two different swing weights to two individual hitters. It’s also why taking some dry swings in a sporting goods store is far from a foolproof way to find the right swing weight. <i>In our opinion, swing weight is the only measurement that truly matters when determining the ‘</i><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17N-vn_P6Z8zws1JoGlQv7SKXRdJBrAgh/edit#heading=h.1kriwpgioe90"><i>right bat size</i></a><i>.’</i>

    <b class="book-term">Swing Weight Calculation</b> You can calculate the swing weight, and we often do in our analysis. To do so, you need the bat’s weight (mass), the distance between the knob and the balance point, as well as the bat’s pendulum period. At the risk of being too technical, the MOI changes as you change the location of your pivot. For consistency, the industry uses 6-inches from the knob to report the swing weight. You can calculate the swing weight of your bat with our at-home <a href="https://www.batdigest.com/bat-size-chart/bat-swing-weight-calculator/">DIY calculator here</a>.

    <b class="book-term">Scale Weight</b>Scale weight is what a bat weighs when placing it on a scale. The single biggest mistake we observe when fitting bats is when people weigh a bat on a scale and think that has a significant effect on how easy or hard a bat is to swing. Swinging a bat is not the same as lifting a bat. Instead of lifting a bat to use it, you rotate it (swing it) around a pivot. Consider the difference in swinging the same sledgehammer when you hold the handle versus the hammer’s head: same scale weight, but a very different experience due to weight distribution. Weighing a bat isn’t very helpful other than getting that number and calculating the swing weight.

    <b class="book-term">Stated Weight</b>The stated weight is the weight stated on the bat. Rarely does the bat weigh (scale weight) the same as the indicated weight. In many cases, the number is 10% or more off. Stated weight is only helpful as a categorization point on department stores’ shelves. It might also be a good starting point when looking for a bat size, but stated weight is an even worse indicator than scale weight when determining how hard a bat might be to swing.

    <b class="book-term">Balance Point</b>A balance point is a place on the bat between the knob and end cap where the bat balances itself. It is the bat mass’s center of gravity. Balance points are not perfect predictors of swing weight, but are used with mass and pendulum periods to calculate the swing weight. If your brain keeps up with all these terms, you’ll realize that the balance point marks the pivot where the MOI of a bat is the lowest. If you can let that phrase sink in, then the rest of this is cake. Using the balance point to differentiate swing weight is not a perfect way to measure swing weight. However, it is better than the stated weight and can usually be done (by balancing it on your finger) while standing in a sporting goods store.

    <b class="book-term">Balanced</b>The term balanced bat claims a bat swings light relative to other bats of class and size. However, no governing body regulates when a company can say something is ‘balanced.’ Several examples exist of bats marketed to have a lighter swing weight (“balanced”) but are instead actually fairly end-loaded. We do not recommend you rely solely on marketing terms about a bat’s swing weight.

    <b class="book-term">End-Loaded</b>End-loaded is the opposite of “balanced.” It refers to a bat that has a higher swing weight. End-load is a term many companies often avoid because it doesn’t have the best connotation. Instead, they opt for terms like POWER, PWR Balanced, Pro Balanced, Slightly End Loaded, Half Balanced, Half End-Loaded---you get the point. This is marketing jargon meant to distract from the fact that the bat is not for everyone. There is no governing standard for what is considered end-loaded.

    <b class="book-term">Sweet Spot</b>There are a few definitions of the ‘sweet spot.’ Sweet spot can be the part where the bat feels the best, and it can also be the part of the barrel where the optimal performance occurs. However, manufacturers do not identify the actual location and size of the sweet spot, which is evidence enough that the difference in sweet spots among top-end brands and models is negligible at best. Finding the official sweet spot as a consumer is complex, but a good hitter with some time in the box can usually dial it in close enough. Scientists in the baseball physics labs tell us the exact sweet spot can only be found experimentally with a ball cannon.

    <b class="book-term">End Cap</b>This is the piece at the end of the barrel that “seals” the bat. It is usually made of some kind of composite. Like the Slugger VELO and Solo, some bats have extended composite end caps that make up the bat’s last two or three inches. This is said to help bring down swing weight and muddies the waters on what we mean when we refer to bats as “hybrid.” Manufacturers claim that the weight, stiffness, and material of the end cap can affect performance. Sure. Why not? But we wouldn’t know because that data is not shared either.

    <b class="book-term">Connection Piece</b>The point where the barrel and handle connect is called the “connection piece.” Much innovation is claimed to have occurred here as manufacturers tend to update the connection pieces often. The claim is that, during these upgrades, the connection piece is tuned for more optimal stiffness. Stiffness, though, isn’t optimal. It is just a preference on feel. As well, the connection point can be one of a few failure points on a two-piece bat.

    <b class="book-term">MAP Pricing</b> MAP stands for Manufacturer Advertised Pricing. When major buyers, like DicksSporting Goods, buy millions of dollars of bats from a manufacturer, they agree upon a minimum price vendors, including DSG, can sell the item for. This agreement protects the big buyers from other sellers undercutting them--and before buying $40,000,000 of DeMarini CF Zens, price protection is the only thing that makes it possible. As consumers, MAP might feel irritating. We often believe we deserve a deal. But, like it or not, the bat business can't work without it. MAP is precisely why you’ll find the same bat for the same price across every site you can find. At a certain point, usually the summer after a bat’s release last fall, bats come off MAP pricing. Then, and only then, vendors have the liberty to sell the bats for whatever they want. Until then, though, if you buy a bat from some underground network for less than MAP then the deal is officially grey market and, if known, won’t have a warranty. Major manufacturers usually aggressively seek out and kibosh any seller breaking MAP.

    <b class="book-term">Shaved Bats</b> Shaved bats are illegal and, in our opinion, immoral (for a couple of reasons, see Bat Certification Standards). Shaved bats are composite bats (shaving does not work on aluminum because thinner alloy walls mean quicker denting) with their inside walls thinned. This thinning creates a greater trampoline effect than the standard allows and significantly decreases the bat’s durability. Shaved bats are likely more popular than anyone in the industry would like to admit, but also probably not as likely as the guy trying to sell you on the idea would have you believe. Of course, manufacturers could produce a tamper-proof end cap that would shut down the shaved bat market in a heartbeat. We’ll save that conspiracy theory for another day. Getting your bat shaved is against Federal Law, but don’t expect that case to be heard by SCOTUS.

    <b class="book-term">Rolled Bats</b> Rolled bats are composite bats that have been “worked-in” through the process of rolling the bat between two metal or urethane cylinders in a bat rolling device. Rolling a bat would do only damage to an alloy bat. In theory, rolling a bat is doing nothing but working in the fibers of a composite bat faster --- something that should happen naturally as the bat is hit. In practice, though, some consider rolling a bat illegal, but read the comments on any forum about this issue and you’ll find significant disagreement on this topic. BBCOR, USA, ASA and USSSA all roll composite bats during the testing process to ensure the bat passes the standard once it is worked in. This is referred to as “ABI” or accelerated break-in testing protocols. One caveat to this: USA Bat claims explicitly that the rolling of a USA Bat is “tampering” and thus, “cheating.” Their words, not ours. At this point, until the major governing bodies in youth and high school make a ruling on this as USA Bat did, it will remain another topic of dispute.

    <b class="book-term">Bat Hype</b> If you’re keeping score from the terms above, (1) swing weight, (2) bat performance testing data and (3) the location of the sweet spot are all not shared with consumers. These are data points that would put to bed any absolute superiority in bats. We get none of that from them. Instead, we get a lot of effort spent on marketing bats to influencers (Bat Digest being one of them), compelling social campaigns, significant donations to visible NCAA baseball schools and a never-ending torrent of, to put it flatly, spin. That is all well and good and, quite often, plenty of fun. Companies are in their right to market their bats and they often do a masterful job. We’ve met many of the marketers at major brands and they are world-class. The silence about actual data on bat performance is, as they say, deafening. We’re not trying to make enemies with that commentary, but if we are to understand anything about finding the right bat, bat hype must be a part of our vocabulary.

    <h3>The Best Right Bat</h3>
<p>That is the $64,000 question -- or lately, it’s become the $499 question.</p>

<p>For starters, we must discuss what we mean by “best.”</p>

    <h3>Notes on Bat Performance</h3>
<p>What is the <i>best </i>bat?</p>

<p>This is the email conversation we love to have with readers, and it always leads us to wonder what “best” even means.</p>

<p>Best value? Best feel? Best exit speeds? Best on-base percentage? Best batting average? Best OPS? Best durability? Best home run hitter? Best YouTube videos?</p>

<p>Most, to be sure, aren’t sure. People just want the best and they haven’t thought long enough about what exactly they mean by that.</p>

<p>Realizing it is rather challenging to find something you don’t know you are looking for, we must start by defining what we mean by 'best bat' performance.</p>
    <h3>The Best Pop</h3>
<p>Most people usually start by thinking the best performance is akin to asking, “What bat has the best pop?”</p>

<p>Bat pop, defined as the amount of trampoline effect at a particular spot on the barrel, is governed by a bat’s certification. BBCOR and ASA limit the performance of high school bats while USSSA, ASA, and USA restrict the performance of youth bats. This means no bat is allowed to perform better than a specific limit.</p>

<p>The truth is, the vast majority of performance bats meet the limit on at least one point of the barrel. That is, according to the tests, they all have about the same pop.</p>

<p>A point of debate is the length at which they meet that max performance. The length might differ from model to model, but it is rarely a long enough difference to change average exit speeds. We have documented this repeatedly in our exit speed tests with thousands and thousands of swings on most models since 2014.</p>

    You can <a href="https://www.batdigest.com/bat-size-chart/raw-exit-speed-data/">buy those data sets if you feel so inclined</a>. We love looking it over, but make no mistake, you’ll rarely see a bat that is more than two mph over any other bat of its class and swing weight on multiple hits. Most are within one mph and the standard error.

<p>To that point, if you ever see someone claiming a certain bat is getting a 3mph or more exit speeds bump over its similarly weighted and certified peers, be certain their method or brain isn’t working right.</p>

<p>The truth about bat pop, which every insider truly knows, is this: Bats of the same certification and swing weight just aren’t that different regarding “pop.”</p>

<p>So what bat has the best pop?</p>

<p>Answer: most of them.</p>

<p>But when people ask us what bat is best, “most of them” doesn’t ring true with their intent.</p>
    <h3>The Best Batting Practice Bat</h3>
<p>Another fundamental problem in determining bat performance is that it often refers to how well a bat performs in batting practice.</p>

<p>Tee up a ball, or throw a pitch in the same spot repeatedly, and even your mom would hit a smoke-job now and again. Some fancy video editing later, and before you know it, every Zumba studio in the country is designing custom bats because no one can find the base model in stock anymore.</p>

<p>But batting practice rarely resembles game speed. And those great with big bats in BP quite often can’t hit a curveball.</p>

<p>Curse you, Jobu.</p>

<p>At the risk of getting booed off stage, in reality, most don’t want the bat that allows them to hit the ball the farthest.</p>

<p>For reals. Let that claim sit there for a moment. Most don't actually want to use the bat they can hit the farthest or hit the fastest.</p>

<p>Instead, most want--even need--the bat they can hit squarely the most often.</p>

<p>That is, most should want the bat that maximizes their general performance, not the one that might occasionally add a mile an hour or two to their exit velocity--especially when that wrong-sized bat makes it harder to be successful in-game. But very few, if any, batting practice bat comparisons care about anything but moon shots and triple-digit exit speeds.</p>

<p>Blame it on easy video editing and a world run by algorithms that incentivize clicks, shares and watch time. But as far as we've kept track, no post titled: "I did really well with this bat over the course of 3 months" ever went viral.</p>
    
<p>Observe the diametrically opposed physical forces of practicality and swing weight, couple that observation with marketing campaigns that know only the rails of clickbait sensationalism, and it quickly becomes apparent why batting practice nukes have become the litmus test for one's best bat.</p>

<p>To be sure, no one is faulting companies and their outlets in making exciting and interesting marketing campaigns. It is marketing, after all. It's what they do. Entertaining things can exist in the same sphere where rational bat decisions are also made.</p>

<p>But if these were cigarettes, we'd demand that bat boxes came labeled with this warning: Results WILL vary because your best bat isn’t the one someone else can hit the farthest.</p>


    <h3>Perception</h3>
<p>If batting practice by proxy is the spokesperson for confusing bat purchasing, then perception by feel is that spokesperson's lesser-known and completely psychotic younger brother.</p>

<p>Let's start here: the distinguishing features in different bat models (namely their connection piece, barrel material, knob construction, and end caps) are designed to give the hitter a certain feel at contact. That isn't a secret. As well, without a doubt, those distinguishing features have virtually nothing to do with the bounce in a bat’s barrel--also not a secret.</p>

<p>Knobs, grips, and connection pieces don't create more or less bounce. (If you don't believe us on connecting pieces, wait for chapter 6).</p>

<p>Despite that obviousness, millions of dollars are dumped into marketing and R&amp;D every year to "improve" these features. But, what has been improved exactly, feel? Because knobs don't bounce baseballs and cushy grips don't hit doubles.</p>

<p>The idea that a bat can feel better with a different grip or knob shape is by no means lost on us. Neither is the idea that a particular feel in the grip or knob can be more comfortable and therefore encourage better swinging. As well, there can and should most definitely be preferences between things like a flared or straight knob, a shaped or round handle, a thick or thin grip, and a loud or hollow sound.</p>

<p>But if these so-called improvements are only capable of attracting hitters based on a preference, why are so many so quick to equate them with better performance?</p>

<p>The deviousness found in the psychotic younger brother named perception is that most don't realize there is even a distinction between what is feel and what is real.</p>

    When someone asks anyone else what bat is best, they most certainly aren’t asking what bat makes it <em>feel</em> like it is the best. They want to know what bat actually performs the best, but rarely is that the answer provided.
    <h3>What To Do</h3>
<p>Because picking a bat is based on personal preferences, you can decide what you mean by ‘best performance’--in other words, what you personally need from a bat-- by answering these questions.</p>
    <ol>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">How appealing is the potential for an occasional hit that is a mile an hour or two better in exit velocity compared to its peers even if it doesn’t feel the best?</li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Do you want the bat you feel like you hit the best, the one you hit as good as the rest for a great price, or the one you hit the fastest the most often?</li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">What kind of hitter are you trying to be?</li>
</ol>
<p>The ‘best’ bat optimizes swing weight, material, certification, and price metrics to maximize a hitter’s individualized preferred performance. This is called bat fitting.</p>

<p>How can we find that bat? The bat that is the best for you? That’s what we’re here to answer.</p>

<section id="chapter_4">
    <h2 class="border-top">Chapter 4</h2>
    <h3 class="display-4 py-5 my-5">The Best Swing Weight</h3>
<p>In our opinion, finding the right swing weight is the number one factor in selecting the right bat.</p>

<p>All other things being equal, a bat with a heavier swing weight hits balls harder. All other things being equal, a faster bat hits balls harder.</p>

<p>But a heavier swinging bat loses what we call swing dexterity---that is to say, how agile and fast one can be with a bat. Hence, the two major forces that determine ball exit velocity, speed and swing weight, stand in direct opposition to each other.</p>

<p>How much swing dexterity should we sacrifice for added swing weight?</p>

<p>Answering that question is at the crux of finding your right bat.</p>

<p>The right swing weight depends on your current size and experience, what type of hitter you want to be and how good your mechanics are.</p>

<p>If you want power, you should be willing to sacrifice dexterity. (Think the number four hitter or making YouTube videos for scouts). If you want to improve your contact, then you’ll sacrifice mass (think the lead-off hitter, a kid learning how to switch hit, or a young player just trying to catch up to fastballs).</p>

<p>If your mechanics are stellar, then the amount of dexterity you trade for added mass is less than what one with poor mechanics will have to trade. So, those with great mechanics might also be willing to take on even more mass.</p>

    There is no way to understand what your optimal swing weight is besides through practice. We’d suggest a quick look at our <a href="https://www.batdigest.com/bat-size-chart/">bat size chart</a> to get an eyeballed start for where you should be, then off to the field.
    <h3>Notes on Swing Weight</h3>
<p>The distinctions between weight and mass at impact (MOI or swing weight) make all the difference.</p>

<p>Consider these topics below when finding the right size bat.</p>
    <h4>Bats of the Same Size, but in Different Models have Different Swing Weights</h4>
<p>One complication arising from how bats are sized is that all bats aren’t created with equal weight distribution. For example, one particular model that is a 31/21 might very well swing quite differently from another model that is also 31/21.</p>

<p>Bats of the same size don’t swing the same. It’s one of the reasons we think bat size charts are sometimes more hurtful than helpful.</p>
    <h4>Swing Weights go Unpublished</h4>
    This would all be easier if manufacturers would share a bat’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17N-vn_P6Z8zws1JoGlQv7SKXRdJBrAgh/edit#bookmark=id.my67zj99t0yz">swing weight</a> with consumers, right?

<p>Sadly, although they have this information, most keep it private. Since the manufacturer won’t share, the only way to know a bat’s swing weight is to measure it. It depends on the bat’s mass, balance point, and pendulum period.</p>

    We measure and publish all the swing weights for most of the bats we test and you can see them on this <a href="https://www.batdigest.com/definitive-swing-weight-guide/">link, here</a>. The password to see the page is <b>SwingWeight</b>.
    <h4>Scale Weight is often Confused with Swing Weight</h4>
<p>Remember from the glossary, swing weight is about how the mass is distributed along the length of the bat---not about the total mass of the bat. Hence, as we say above, bats of the same size might differ in swing weight considerably.</p>

<p>It feels like a very mean trick, but it's played on bat consumers constantly.</p>
    <h4>Finding the Balance Between More Weight and More Speed</h4>
<p>What is the optimal interplay between bat speed and swing weight?</p>

<p>It matters what kind of hitter you want to be, as we say above, but there is some empirical research.</p>

<p>The most robust study found at the University of Arizona suggests you get a swing weight that lowers your maximum swing speed by 2% (see footnote 1). So, if you swing at 75mph with a 32-inch broomstick, then find the swing weight that puts your 32-inch bat at 73.5mph.</p>

<p>The study claims that this formula gives you enough dexterity to find pitches and still leaves enough mass to hit the ball hard.</p>
    <h4>What to Do</h4>
<p>Keeping in mind the pitfalls above, you can get to work finding the swing weight you need.</p>

    <b class="book-term">Option 1</b>: In the world of infinite time and money, our best solution is to get multiple bats of multiple sizes. Then hit live BP and increase your bat’s weight while measuring hand speed via BlastMotion. When you see hand speed take a measurable drop, then you know you've hit your limit. Use either the first bat past the limit or the last bat before.

    <b class="book-term">Option 2</b>: If you don’t want to do that, then use our <a href="https://www.batdigest.com/bat-size-chart/">bat size chart</a> to get a good starting point. Find our <a href="https://www.batdigest.com/definitive-swing-weight-guide/">swing weights</a> (password SwingWeight) to get a feel for how bats scale in their difficulty to swing. Find ways to increase and decrease swing weight to see if hand or bat speed changes much. Keep increasing swing weight as long as dexterity remains unchanged.

<p>Also, note: When in doubt, lighter is better than heavier. And be sure to consider in-game swing versus practice tee swing.</p>

<p>In the end, there is no way to find the best swing weight without experimentation. So, get practicing.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <h3>Certifications</h3>
<p>The right bat must meet the bat standard your son or daughter currently plays. No one wants to buy a bat, take off the wrapper and realize that your league is a USA standard league and you’re holding a USSSA bat. You won’t be able to use it.</p>

<p>For baseball, there are three categories: BBCOR, USSSA and USA.</p>

<p>For fastpitch, there are two categories: ASA and USSSA.</p>
    <h3>Our Best Guesses</h3>
<p>Most leagues have their bat standards published on their website. Often, too, a coach or parent will know.</p>

<p>We suggest you don’t guess, but in general…</p>

<p>High school baseball, and high school age travel leagues, are almost always BBCOR unless you’re in a state like New Mexico that requires wood bats. Many other high school level travel type tourneys are wood bat only.</p>

<p>Perfect Game under the age of 14, USSSA, Triple Crown and many if not most other youth travel ball leagues are almost always USSSA.</p>

<p>Little League International and Cal Ripken is always USA. Other rec leagues are often USA, but there is much liberty here when you start to talk rec ball.</p>

<p>High school fastpitch is always ASA.</p>

<p>Little League fastpitch is almost always ASA.</p>

<p>Mens’ fastpitch is USSSA.</p>

    This simplifies the current bat rules across the country, but there are always ones that seem to pop up out of nowhere. Know thy rules. We try to keep these as up-to-date as possible. For a more in-depth read, check out: <a href="https://www.batdigest.com/blog/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-baseball-bat-rules/"><b>A Hitchhiker’s Guide to Bat Rules</b></a><b>.</b>

<p>To know for sure, just ask. Someone who is a part of that league should know what bats are required. Check the rules.</p>
    <h4>Multiple Leagues, Multiple Bats</h4>
<p>We know that some of your kids may need different bats with different certifications. It is not uncommon to see a 12-year-old playing in a USSSA tourney and then turning around and playing in a local tourney using a USA bat or BBCOR. So technically, it’s possible to use USA, USSSA and BBCOR in the same season/week.</p>

<p>That’s why getting this right is so important (to your kid and your wallet).</p>
    <h4>When to Use BBCOR</h4>
<p>Some USA and USSSA leagues allow BBCOR bats and some BBCOR and USSSA leagues might allow USA bats. However, no USA or BBCOR leagues allow USSSA bats.</p>

<p>We are proponents of BBCOR use in older USA-sanctioned leagues because they are similar in performance and might better prepare your kid for the swing weight transition to high school.</p>

<p>If you are allowed USSSA bats, you are putting your player at a measurable performance disadvantage if you are using a drop 3 BBCOR or a USA bat in-game. That is to say, if you are allowed to swing USSSA, take the advantage and swing a USSSA bat.</p>

<p>By 14U, we think you should be purchasing a BBCOR if your kid decides to continue their career on the big field.</p>
    <h4>What to Do</h4>
<p>Verify the rules about bats in the league or tournament you are playing in.</p>

<p>Step 1: Find the league’s name or tournament and check their website or the people running these leagues about bat certification requirements.</p>

<p>Step 2: Coaches and other parents who have participated in leagues, particularly rec leagues, are a good source for how well rules are known and whether bat rules online are followed/enforced generally in a league. Rec leagues have the most variation in bat certification rules.</p>

<p>Step 3: Use the bat with the best trampoline effect allowed in your league. For example, if your league accepts USSSA and USA bat, use the USSSA bat for better performance. If your league allows wood or BBCOR metal and composite bats, a non-wood bat will typically help with performance (more on wood vs. non-wood later).</p>

    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <h3>Construction Features</h3>
<p>Now that we understand the significance of swing weights and certifications, we can consider the additional features of</p>
    <ol>
        <li>feel</li>
        <li>perception</li>
        <li>durability</li>
        <li>barrel profile and</li>
        <li>price</li>
</ol>
<p>and how these generally manifest in different bat types.</p>

<p>Specifically, we take each one of those 5 features and discuss them in the context of the size major bat types.</p>

<p>The six different bat types include:</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Two-Piece Composite</li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Single-Piece Composite</li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Hybrid (Alloy Barrel)</li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Wood composite</li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Single-Piece Alloy</li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Wood*</li>
</ol>
    <h3>How to Use this Section</h3>
<p>This section makes more sense if you have a shortlist of preferences that you are looking for in your bat. Our intent is that, as you read through, you'll find a bat type or two which has many or most of the features you'd appreciate.</p>

<p>If you are looking for the right bat, take a moment to think about what your preferences are surrounding the five broad features of each bat type (feel, perception, durability, barrel profile, and price). As an example, maybe you want a bat that feels great all the time, you think a good perception is important for the hitter, you care a lot about durability, you don't care much about the profile, and you have a reasonable budget.</p>

<p>Now, as you read through the following, see which bat types generally check those boxes.</p>

    <strong>Notes Worth Mentioning</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>If you don't know what you're looking for, then you'll never find a bat that works. This is why these features and your preferences of them matter. You must have a preference or you'll end up standing in the sporting good aisle, scrolling through batdigest.com on your phone, with no idea what to do.</li>
        <li>You don't have to have a preference for each of the features, but form an opinion on at least two and you'll be well on your way to getting the right bat.</li>
</ol>
    <strong>Defining the Features and their Price</strong>

<p>These are GENERAL guidelines on what these bat features mean and how they price out.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feel: the way a bat feels on hits and mishits. Bats that feel better on mishits cost more.</li>
        <li>Perception: the impression hitters are given of ball flight and success while hitting. It is not the same as the above "feel," although we could have used that word---it was already taken. Bats with better perceptions tend to cost more.</li>
        <li>Durability: how long we expect a bat to last. Oddly, there is no price correlation here.</li>
        <li>Barrel Profile: the length a bat's barrel is at max diameter. A higher profile generally means a higher price.</li>
        <li>Price: the new cost of a bat in this category.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>There are always exceptions to these rules, but different features by bat type play out in the bat market writ large.</p>
    <div class="border-bottom border-success py-2"></div>
    <h2>A - Two-Piece Composite</h2>
<i>(Fastpitch Note: Two-piece composite bats make up the vast majority of fastpitch bats on the market.)</i></p>

    <b class="book-term">A1: Swing Weight</b> - Two-piece composite bats can be, and often are, constructed to be lighter than other types of bats. Of course, there are exceptions to this, but the heavier two-piece composite bats are usually designated as a PWR or loaded version of the bat. 
    
<p>If you want the lightest swing possible, a two-piece composite bat is likely in your future.</p>

    <b class="book-term">A2: Feel</b> - The smoothest smash of them all, two-piece composites tend to feel great on both hits and mishits. The connection points are generally more flexible than their hybrid counterparts.

    <b class="book-term">A3: Durability</b> - Aside from wood, two-piece composite is likely the least durable of all the types of bat constructions.

    <b class="book-term">A4: Profile</b> - Two-piece composite bats almost always have the largest profile of any bat save single-piece composite bats.

    <b class="book-term">A5: Price</b> - Two-piece composite bats are almost always the most expensive. Some of this is justified by the higher production and warranty replacement costs the company incurs. As well, certification can run into the tens of thousands of dollars. 
    
<p>But is any bat price justified? More on that later.</p>

    <b class="book-term">A6: Perception</b> - Because of the feel, the perception of performance is usually best with two-piece composite bats---especially in the younger crowd who appreciate smooth smashes, even on mishits. In fastpitch specifically, two-piece composite bats make up well over 90% of the market for even the highest level hitters.

    <b class="book-term">Who are Two-Piece Composites The Best For -</b> We think two-piece composite bats are best for those who want a big barrel, light swing, and a buttery smash on hits and mishits alike. Meaning: hitters under the age of 15 are often suitable for a two-piece composite. Hitters 15 and older can use a two-piece composite with a lot of success. We, at least occasionally, see Div I NCAA players using a two-piece composite. For younger hitters who play elite baseball and need as much plate coverage, swing speed, and flex as possible, then a two-piece composite is our go-to recommendation.
    <div class="border-bottom border-success py-2"></div>
    <h2>B - Single-Piece Composite</h2>
<i>(Fastpitch Note: There are a few single-piece composite fastpitch bats. They might make up a generous 1% of the entire market).</i></p>

    <b class="book-term">B1: Swing Weight</b> - Single-piece composite bats come in every swing weight you can imagine. You can find the right fit for your hitter, but be sure to look for what you want here, as there is very little consistency in the swing weight of single-piece composite bats. Some swing extraordinarily heavy; others are unusually light. They are all over the map.

    <b class="book-term">B2: Feel </b>- Single-piece composite bats can often feel more like a two-piece composite than a single-piece alloy. Even though made of a single piece of composite, the material itself allows for more flex and, therefore, it's less stiff than a single piece of alloy. If you want a two-piece feel in a one-piece design, then single-piece composite is an excellent way to go.

    <b class="book-term">B3: Durability </b>- Durability for single-piece composite bats is okay. They are more durable than their two-piece composite counterparts but far from the indestructibility of an ironclad single-piece alloy.

    <b class="book-term">B4: Profile</b> - The profile of single-piece composite bats is usually absolutely massive--the biggest in the business. Single-piece composite bats are almost always at the top of any barrel diameter challenge.

    <b class="book-term">B5: Price</b> - It depends on the brand, but the price for single-piece composite bats is usually close to two-piece composite bats. That is, on the expensive side and for similar reasons. Again, material and certification prices might justify this when compared to alloy barrels.

    <b class="book-term">B6: Perception </b>- Our experience is that most good hitters who can square up a ball, no matter the age, perceive single-piece composite bats to perform at the top of the charts. Of course, the certification standards keep even single-piece composite bats in check with the field, but that doesn’t distract those who like single-piece composite bats and believe they have found something special. They might be right. Massive barrel profiles, a good range of swing weights and a nice flexible feel on a somewhat durable bat make for happy hitters who feel like their bat is helping them hit bombs.

    <b class="book-term">Who are Single Piece Composites Best For</b> - Single-piece composite bats are for those that want a single-piece bat, a massive barrel profile, and a semi-flexible feel. That category might include any number of age and size combinations. We see young 10-year-olds, as well as a handful of elite D1 NCAA teams alike, hitting well with single-piece composites. If a hitter wants an under-the-radar bat with some bang when they hit it on the screws, a single-piece composite is our go-to.
    <div class="border-bottom border-success py-2"></div>
    <h2>C - Hybrid (Composite Handle/Alloy Barrel)</h2>
<p>(<i>Fastpitch Note: The only fastpitch hybrid on the market, at least that is worth talking about, is the Anderson Rocketech</i>).</p>

    <b class="book-term">C1: Swing Weight</b> - Hybrid bats tend to swing heavier than two-piece composite bats. At one point, most hybrids were considered end-loaded, but tech advancements and market demand have given rise to more moderately weighted hybrid bats. Don’t expect to find a very balanced hybrid, but the middle-of-the-road and end-loaded hybrids are plentiful.

    <b class="book-term">C2: Feel</b> - Hybrid bats often have the same connection piece used in their two-piece composite counterparts tuned to greater stiffness. Since many hybrid bats are marketed toward bigger hitters who prefer stiffer connections, many hybrids have very rigid connections. There are some exceptions here, but expect more feedback from a hybrid than you’d get from a two-piece composite.

    <b class="book-term">C3: Durability</b> - Durability for hybrids is better than two-piece composite or single-piece composite bats. The alloy barrels can last a lifetime. Many NCAA players today (2021) are still using hybrid bats from the mid to early 2010s. If they do fail, it’s at the connection piece or end cap.

    <b class="book-term">C4: Profile</b> - Hybrid bats, with their alloy barrels, usually have barrel profiles that are smaller than two-piece composite or single-piece composite bats. Often, though, they are bigger than single-piece alloy bats and pretty much always bigger than wood bats.

    <b class="book-term">C5: Price</b> - Hybrids usually cost less than two-piece composite or single-piece composite bats, but are generally more expensive than single-piece alloy bats. Per bat, they are also more costly than wood and wood composite bats.

    <b class="book-term">C6: Perception</b> - Over the last 18 months, hybrid bats in baseball, especially in BBCOR, have taken off. Despite being governed by the same performance standard as their non-hybrid peers, hybrid bats are almost hard to find in stock. Social media plugs have done a tremendous job here, but there are likely some other reasons too. The price point has always been more attractive. Swing weights of hybrids have become more manageable for the masses. The durability of an alloy and the image of NCAA teams using almost 10-year-old bats have made hybrids the most popular bats on the market today. The stiffer connections give some big hitters a sense that they’re hitting rockets.

    <b class="book-term">Who are Hybrids Best For</b> - Hybrid bats are a great transition bat from two-piece composite. The more recent and broader range in swing weights makes it a good fit for the medium to the big hitter that has played enough baseball to know that not every swing should feel like punching a pillow. The outstanding freshman, budding sophomore, and good to great upperclassmen are where we think hybrid bats fit the best most often. For younger baseball players still in USSSA, we’ve yet to find many who prefer the perception of hybrids over two-piece composites. USA bats have a couple of hybrids that are gaining traction.
    <div class="border-bottom border-success py-2"></div>
<i>(Fastpitch Note: There are no fastpitch bats constructed with wood composites)</i>.</p>

    <b class="book-term">D1: Swing Weight</b> - Wood composite bats are typically heavier, end-loaded bats. Like wood bats, the material makes it challenging to engineer a bat to provide for various swing weights.

    <b class="book-term">D2: Feel</b> - Wood composite bats are stiff and feel more like wood--with a bit of give. They are, after all, wood. That said, and we have trouble putting our finger on it exactly, but wood composites have yet to capture the feel of a top-end wood bat. They’re close, but with our eyes closed, we could still tell the difference 10 out of 10 times.

    <b class="book-term">D3: Durability</b> - Wood composites are, depending on the model, the most durable bats in the business---even more durable than single-piece alloy bats, if that’s even possible. Some composite wood bats are made to withstand serious damage. A wood composite is more durable than wood --- that is primarily their point.

    <b class="book-term">D4: Profile</b> - Wood composite’s barrel profiles are typically small in size--similar to a wood bat profile. Once again, to manipulate swing weight into more crowd-friendly sizing, barrel profile is one feature engineers sacrifice.

    <b class="book-term">D5: Price</b> - Depending on the brand and relative to composite, wood composite bats are usually less expensive. They are priced similarly to high-end wood bats. But, since they are typically a one-time cost and last through the zombie apocalypse, they should outlive the life of a wood bat or two or three.

    <b class="book-term">D6: Perception</b> - Few amateur hitters believe they are hitting the ball better with a wood composite than they can with a single-piece alloy, two-piece composite, or hybrid. But most feel like they do as well with a wood composite as with the less durable wood. They are probably right in most instances. Under the same standard, wood composite can perform like metal or composite BBCOR or USA bats. But the smaller profile and relatively narrow band of swing weight offerings rarely generate the average exit speeds you’ll find in metal or composite BBCOR or USA. That said, there are at least a couple of hitters that can make a wood composite sing.

    <b class="book-term">Who are Wood Composites Best For</b> - Wood composites, we believe, are made for the hitter that is looking for a wood bat but wants one with durability. They might sacrifice some of that ineffable truly wood quality in feel. But performance and profile are the same while durability shoots through the roof. For most kids, limited swing weight options, unforgiving feel, and overall performance of wood composite bats mean cross these off the shortlist. But for those with some extra scratch and a preference for durability, composite wood might be the best #2 to put in your bag.
    <div class="border-bottom border-success py-2"></div>
    <h2>E - Single-Piece Alloy</h2>
<i>(Fastpitch Note: We are not aware of any serious contender of performance fastpitch bats that are a single-piece alloy).</i></p>

    <b class="book-term">E1: Swing Weight</b> - Once thought to be more endloaded, the swing weight of single-piece alloy bats is now all over the place. They are rarely lighter swinging than the lightest two-piece composite or single-piece composite bat. But, they can get close on the light end and match, pound for pound, the swing weight of the heaviest hybrid bats on the market.

    <b class="book-term">E2: Feel</b> - Single-piece alloy bats are the king of stiffness, matched only by wood. Although there is some debate here, single-piece alloy bats often feel stiffer and less forgiving than wood. It follows, then, that those who swing single-piece bats will get great feedback on mishits and that home-run-feel when it is, in fact, a home run.

    <b class="book-term">E3: Durability</b> - On the whole, single-piece alloy bats are the most durable of the bunch. Probably even more durable than even the most durable of wood composite bats, but we’ve yet to shoot either with a high-powered rifle. High-quality alloy bats are built for the apocalypse and should last your player and his younger brother as long as they need that size.

    <b class="book-term">E4: Profile</b> - The barrel profile of single-piece alloy bats is equal to or smaller than hybrid bats. Of all the alloy and composite options, single-piece alloy bats tend to have the smallest barrel profile. The weight costs required to make an alloy bat from stem to stern are exacted from the barrel’s profile.

    <b class="book-term">E5: Price </b>- Compared to the others on this list, single-piece alloy bats tend to be the least expensive overall option. A single-piece alloy bat almost always makes the top of the list in terms of best value.

    <b class="book-term">E6: Perception</b> - Great hitters often prefer single-piece bats because the perception they give is both more honest and wood-like. They do not perform any better than hybrid or two-piece composite bats because they are not allowed to. Still, though, exceptional hitters prefer bats that provide feedback and make them honest hitters.

    <b class="book-term">Who are Single-Piece Alloys Best For - </b> Due to the range in swing weights, single-piece alloy bats are best for a whole range of players, especially those looking for a reasonable value on a high-performing bat. Single-piece alloy bats are the ‘smart buys.’ Those who like honest feedback in a stiff feeling contact will prefer single-piece alloy bats more than those who want sting dampening and a big barrel. As we see it, the perfect hitter for a single-piece alloy is the heavy-hitting upper-classman who wants all the end load and feedback they can get. In a close second is the newer BBCOR player looking for wood-like feedback, a light swing, and a reasonable price on a new bat. In USA and USSSA, we value the feel of two-piece bats at a premium. However, those youth players who want to save a considerable amount could be thrilled with an appropriately sized single-piece alloy.
    <div class="border-bottom border-success py-2"></div>
    <h2>F - Wood</h2>
<i>(Fastpitch Note: Fastpitch bats do not come in wood.)</i></p>

    <b class="book-term">F1: Swing Weight - </b>Inch for inch, expect the swing weight of wood bats to be end-loaded. Wood bats do not have the luxury of manipulating swing weight through metal additives or composite layers. It can be difficult to find wood bats with swing weights that fit the non-adult

    <b class="book-term">F2: Feel - </b>Wood bats feel classic and honest, but unforgiving. When you hit with wood, you feel the hit. In the hands of a young, developing player, wood can be painful and discouraging. In the hands of the right upperclassman, it can be empowering and maturing. Use wood with a player who already loves the game enough to appreciate the honest feedback and knows that not every swing should feel like a dinger.

    <b class="book-term">F3: Perception - </b>In the hands of a non-professional baseball player, wood does not typically maximize the perception of performance and actual performance. Few genuinely believe they can hit the ball harder with wood than an alloy or composite. The College World Series, where wood bats are allowed, have yet to host a wood bat at the plate. And likely for a good reason. Even the best amateur baseball players believe a wood bat is inferior to composite or alloy bats. That said, those who try wood at USA and BBCOR levels do get street cred.

    <b class="book-term">F4: Durability - </b>Wood has the lowest durability of any bat material. They break more often and need replacing, particularly if deep cupping at the endcap has been employed to adjust swing weight.

    <b class="book-term">F5: Barrel Profile - </b>Small. Similar to wood composite, barrel size is often slimmed to adjust swing weight. There are just no engineering options to create wood bats with impressive barrel size.<b> </b>

    <b class="book-term">F6: Price - </b>Wood can be expensive. Wood bats, individually, cost less than high-end single-piece alloy bats (the next cheapest option, usually). However, wood bats break and rarely come with a warranty longer than a few weeks. Multiple wood bats in a season can end up being a more expensive option than one durable metal or composite bat. As a practice or occasional use bat, this is an inexpensive option to add to your bag.

    <b class="book-term">Who are Wood Bats Best For </b>- Wood is not likely to be the right in-game bat for most players. As with our composite wood assessment, we think wood can be an excellent way to increase the difficulty for a skilled hitter looking for long-term development. If you are participating in a tournament or league that requires wood bats, then those who appreciate the traditionalism of wood will prefer wood over wood composite, at a cost. Many serious players have a wood bat option in their bag for the occasional BP session or when your team is up by double digits.

    <h3>How Bat Types Compare</h3>

<p>With a strong understanding of each construction and material type, any consumer can safely navigate the waters of choosing the right bat. However, suppose after eliminating the bulk of choices, you still find yourself staring at two bat types, wondering what the ultimate differences might be. In that case, a few specific comparisons in the topics below might help with your final determination.</p>

<p>We’ll make these specific comparisons below.</p>
    <ol>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Wood vs Composite Wood</li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Composite Barrels vs Alloy Barrels</li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Single-Piece vs Two-Piece</li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Hybrid vs Two-Piece-Composite</li>
</ol>
    <div class="border-bottom border-success py-2"></div>
    <h2>Wood vs. Composite Wood</h2>
<p>Composite wood seems to be making a comeback lately, with wood bat tournaments popping up everywhere and some prominent leagues allowing a handful of wood composite brands.</p>

<p>With barrel profiles, swing weight options, and initial cost (assuming very high-end wood bats) similar to wood, the reason to choose wood-composite over wood is durability. A wood composite bat should outlive at least one wood bat if not all the timber in British Columbia.</p>

<p>That said, we’ve yet to see a player test a composite wood vs. a high-end wood and then turn around and say: ‘You know what, I really like this composite one over the natural wood.’ It just doesn't happen. They might like them equally, but the psyche of swinging a true wood bat captures the imagination. While composite wood bats are incredibly durable and can perform like wood, they have yet to truly capture the feel of a high-end wood bat---at least as far as we believe. Others can disagree.</p>

<p>But, unlike those high-end wood bats, they don’t break.</p>

    <b>Still undecided?</b>

<p>We say buy an MLB-grade wood bat from a high-end manufacturer and see what you think. More than likely, you’ll fall in love. Take pictures and videos because life can be short. If it breaks in a year, replace it with a composite wood bat and tell everyone how much you hate wood because it breaks. Secretly, though, sneak those old pictures and videos into the family scrapbook.</p>
    <div class="border-bottom border-success py-2"></div>
    <h2>Composite Barrels vs. Alloy Barrels</h2>
<p>You might still be stuck looking at two bats with opposite barrels. Maybe a hybrid and a two-piece composite or a single-piece-alloy and a single-piece composite.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t be the first standing in a sporting goods store waiting for two different models to grow lips and speak to you.</p>

<p>When comparing composite and alloy barrels, there are at least three specific differences worth considering.</p>
    <h3>Heat vs. Cold</h3>
<p>The way different types of bats break is helpful to understand when deciding between the durability of alloy and composite.</p>

<p>Aluminum bats don’t “break,” instead, they dent. As long as the dent is small, it has minimal effect on performance. Most dents on alloy bats are micro dents, imperceptible to the hitter. On the other hand, when composite bats break, they don’t dent, they crack. You can’t use a cracked bat (for too long anyway) because it eventually cracks in half. The failure of a composite bat is catastrophic, while the failure of an alloy bat is potentially imperceptible.</p>

<p>On a related note, in cold weather, baseballs and softballs condense, becoming harder. They are made of string and leather, not plastic and aluminum, so cold weather makes the ball denser--a level of density bats are potentially not equipped to deal with. It follows, then, that in cold weather, a harder ball is more likely to ‘break’ your bat---any bat---because a more dense ball will put more force per square inch on your bat.</p>

<p>But, a broken alloy is still viable because micro dents mean virtually nothing. A broken composite on the other hand, is game over.</p>

<p>This is precisely why manufacturers suggest you avoid composite bats in cold weather. It has NOTHING to do with the alloy or composite being hot or cold. It has EVERYTHING to do with the hardness of the ball. (Hence the reason so-called ‘bat warmers’ are nothing more than snake oil.)</p>

<p>Consider the climate in which you play to determine what material is suitable for your bat. There is no standard cutoff for what is considered “cold.” We live in Utah and New Jersey, so ball games in the low 50’s (where the folks in Florida would cancel the season) are common in early spring---and composite bats do just fine.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a reason to choose one or the other, the climate could be a factor when buying a composite or alloy.</p>

<p>Did either bat grow lips during that?</p>

<p>No. Okay. Try the next one.</p>
    <h3>Light vs. Heavy</h3>
<p>Do composite bats swing lighter?</p>

<p>Generally, sort of.</p>

<p>The nature of composite allows it to swing lighter with roughly the same amount of plate coverage. That is also to say, you can have better plate coverage with a bigger barrel profile of a composite for the exact cost in swing weight.</p>

<p>To be sure, some composite bats are built for a heavy swing, while many alloy bats are constructed with light swings. But, if it’s plate coverage per swing weight you want to maximize, then an appropriately sized composite barrel is going to win out here.</p>

<p>And don’t be run off the reservation by conversations online about scale weight. Remember scale weight? A composite bat might weigh more on a scale, but we don’t care. The weight distribution matters and composite engineers have much more liberty in putting the weight in composite bats.</p>

<p>It follows, then, that if you know nothing but the fact you want a lighter swing, you’re generally better off going with a composite barrel. Want more heft to maximize power? Alloy is ‘probably’ your best bet.</p>

    Refer back to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17N-vn_P6Z8zws1JoGlQv7SKXRdJBrAgh/edit#heading=h.qqkae6mi56hi">section on swing weight</a> for the reasons you might want more or less swing weight and how heavy or light models swing.
    <h3>Barrel Profiles</h3>
<p>Do composite bats have bigger barrel profiles?</p>

<p>Generally, yes.</p>

<p>Composite bats tend to have bigger barrel profiles than alloy bats per given size. Due to the lighter nature of composite compared to aluminum, engineers can add more volume to the barrel without making the bat too heavy.</p>

<p>Now, do bigger barrels make you hit the ball better? Theoretically, yes. Contact is just a function of plate coverage, after all.</p>

<p>But, in practice, the difference in plate coverage between a ‘big’ alloy barrel and a ‘big’ composite barrel is likely not that much. Effectively, we’re talking about a 1/8th or 1/16th of an inch over 3 or 4 inches. The quantum computer we have in the garage tells us this size difference will allow you to foul a ball off one more time every 3,511 swings. (We just made those numbers up. We don’t have a quantum computer. Our point here is that we don’t think the benefit of a bigger barrel profile matters as much as some might have us believe. We could be wrong.)</p>

<p>While a bigger profile no doubt gives you more chances to stay alive in the count, and a wider barrel gives rise to the theory of a longer sweet spot (even if exit speeds don’t bear that out), we don’t think a barrel’s profile should be on the super-short list of reasons why it is the right bat.</p>

<p>But, if you’re still standing in the sporting goods aisle waiting for a bat to grow lips, a bigger profile on the composite might be enough reason to get on with your life..</p>
    <h3>Still Undecided?</h3>
<p>If the right one still seems elusive after those differentiations between composite and alloy barrels, our final piece of advice would be to buy the cheaper one. All other things being equal, the rational choice is to spend less money.</p>

<p>Or, if one of the bats is two-piece and the other is a single-piece, read on.</p>
    <div class="border-bottom border-success py-2"></div>
    <h2>Single-Piece or Two-Piece?</h2>
    <h3>The ONLY Difference: Perception</h3>
<p>The only difference between single-piece and two-piece bats is the PERCEPTION they give you on performance---not the actual performance.</p>

<p>As we discussed at the beginning of this guide, companies restricted by performance standards are forced to do the next best thing: make it appear their bats are performing better. The single-piece vs. two-piece design differences are geared exclusively towards that principle. There is no difference in barrel pop between single-piece and two-piece bats. The only functional difference is the perception it gives the hitter.</p>

<p>Think we’re crazy?</p>

<p>We might be, but not because we’re wrong about this.</p>
    <h3>What does Stiffness mean for More Power to the Ball?</h3>
<p>Let’s make sure we’re on the same page here because the perception of inherent performance around bat stiffness from one and two-piece bats is, to put it nicely, muddied.</p>

<p>It is often argued that a stiff bat transfers more power to the ball. Or, on the other side of this mythical coin, some say that bat whip increases head speed on two-piece bats. Regardless of which camp you’re in, both argue that the difference in connection makes a difference in performance.</p>

<p>Both are wrong.</p>
    <h3>Stiffness Myth</h3>
<p>The level of stiffness makes no difference in exit velocities because the ball exits the barrel before the bat’s stiffness has any say in the trampoline effect.</p>

<p>We, and others, have proven this concept time and time again.</p>

<p>If you have a ball cannon and a very high-speed camera (which we do), you can see that the flexibility in bats doesn’t occur until AFTER the ball has trampolined from the barrel.</p>

<p>The impact of the bat and ball is in milliseconds.</p>

<p>Although in a roundabout way, the fact that stiffness plays no part in exit velo is also proven in pointing out that not a single one of the certification testing facilities uses a different test for measuring exit speeds on single and two piece bats. All use a stationary bat with a high-speed pitch out of a ball cannon.</p>

<p>The only thing a more flexible connection does is deliver less vibration to your hands after the ball leaves the barrel. That is, ahem, it just <i>feels </i>different. That’s it.</p>

<p>You hear coaches talk about the relationship between feel vs. real. This applies to bats too.</p>
    <h3>Bat Whip Myth</h3>
<p>Another theory that creeps up during the two-piece vs. one-piece debate concerns whip. Specifically, some contend a two-piece has an advantage because it will bend backward during the downswing and then snap forward when making contact with the ball. It isn’t a bat, you see. It’s a trebuchet. This was believed to increase barrel speed at impact. Thus, some say, two-piece bats are better than one-piece bats.</p>

<p>Are we just allowed to say, ‘false, not true, next question?’ Or do we need to give some reasoning here?</p>

<p>We’ll make this quick.</p>

<p>First off, how does the bat know when the ball is coming? And then, somehow, go the other way before contact? Again, exit velocity is determined by a bounce, not a sling-shot.</p>

<p>Second, if you are swinging a bat that is so flexible it will bend backward while swinging through stationary air, how is it supposed to stand up when colliding with an actual object flying toward it?</p>

<p>The answer: it won’t.</p>

<p>Anyway, bats do not bend BEFORE the hit. If yours does, your bat is broken.</p>

<p>Bats can and do sometimes bend AFTER the hit. There are several pictures on the internet showing this phenomenon that muddy the waters on bat whip.</p>
    <h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>There are no exceptions to the stiffness and bat whip myths.</p>

<p>But, in terms of what types of bats are stiff or flexible, there are some. Some wood bats, especially bamboo, feel very flexible. Some two-piece bats can be built with very rigid connections.</p>
    <h3>Still Undecided?</h3>
<p>At the risk of guessing wrong, if you're stuck on this decision, we’d venture to say that most like the idea of a two-piece but want the price of a one-piece.</p>

<p>Is the extra money worth the difference?</p>

<p>Generally, the smaller and younger the player is, the more they will appreciate flexible two-piece bats. The bigger and better they are, the more they can understand stiffer and single-piece bats. The middle age of that equation might be 16 or 17 years old? But still, lots of excellent D1 players are using two-piece hybrids.</p>

<p>If it were us and we had a young kid who would play a lot of baseball or fastpitch, then we’d spend the extra money to get a two-piece, assuming the swing weight was correct. That’s an especially easy suggestion for us to make when it's your money we’re talking about.</p>
    <div class="border-bottom border-success py-2"></div>
    <h2>Hybrid vs. Two-Piece Composite</h2>
<p>Another typical head-to-head matchup decision we find ourselves in is the hybrid vs. two-piece composite conundrum.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, a two-piece composite will give a bigger barrel profile, lighter swing, and higher price point compared to a hybrid. Those composite barrels also tend to sound more wood-like and feel better.</p>
    <h3>Work In Time</h3>
<p>With hybrids and their alloy barrels, you get the reputation for buying a bat that is ‘hot out of the wrapper,’ while composite barrels, some suggest, require work in time.</p>

<p>Despite that popular opinion, however, since about 2019, most manufacturers suggest you don’t need to work in your composite bats anymore --- each of them is ready to go from swing one.</p>

<p>Our exit speed data shows this recent claim by manufacturers is primarily accurate. Most newer composite bats don’t need work in time to improve their exit speed averages.</p>

<p>However, composite barrels do start to sound different. It is possible manufacturers, worried about warranty costs, try to have fewer warranty claims and therefore now suggest the bats are worked in over time. But we’ll save that conspiracy theory for another day.</p>
    <h3>Still Undecided?</h3>
<p>If you’re stuck between a two-piece composite and hybrid bat, and the above differences don’t sway you one way or the other, then we suggest you focus on the bat with the right swing weight. If the hybrid is a bit heavy and you’re willing to get it for some other reason, we think you’ll be more successful with the bat that is the right swing weight over the bat built with the makeup that might appeal to you for some ineffable reason.</p>

<p>If it’s a function of price, all other things being equal, then spend less money. That is, if it’s cheaper, buy the hybrid even if the CF is calling your name.</p>

<p>If you’re still unconvinced, we say if the hitter is under 16, buy the two-piece composite. 16 or older? Buy the hybrid.</p>

<section id="chapter_8">
    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    <h3>Fastpitch Bats</h3>

<p>Although directed to both fastpitch and baseball bat buyers, we notice what we’ve discussed so far seems slanted towards baseball. With that in mind, we feel like a section dedicated explicitly to fastpitch bats can be helpful for those in the market.</p>

<p>In general, most fastpitch bats are more balanced than end-loaded and their drops do not go below -8. Strong power hitters with elite bat speed can and probably should use -8s. Don’t buy a -8 for your 11-year-old daughter just because her brother was swinging a -8 bat at the same age.</p>

<p>Bat speed is even more critical in fastpitch because as you age up, balls are coming in at ridiculous speeds from less than 40 feet. Thus, for younger players, a balanced bat is the best way to go.</p>

<p>Along that same line of thinking, don’t buy a drop 10 or 11 for your high-level upper-classman in high school or college ballplayer. Successful hitting is directly correlated with the mass in your bat, and the more you can handle, the better (see our swing weight guide above).</p>

<p>Unlike baseball, where one-piece alloys or hybrids have a vast market share, the fastpitch world is dominated by composite, mostly two-piece bats. Some one-piece composite bats have come to market, and hybrid bats have been popular (especially in cold weather), but overall, two-piece composite dominates this market.</p>

<p>It is relatively easy to buy a used fastpitch bat online, so confirm whether it is on a banned list. Fastpitch bats at the NCAA level have a “strike” system that phases out the bats, apparently due to failed compression testing, but also, in our opinion, based on how long a bat has been on the market.</p>

    <a href="https://www1.arbitersports.com/Groups/104484/Library/files/JULY2021_WSB_Approved_Softball_Bat_List_071221.pdf">This list can help.</a>

<p>Many NCAA bats are banned for men, but they do not have a system that phases out older bats. Their procedure seems to have nothing to do with making you buy a new bat in a new color. Thank goodness.</p>

</section>

<section id="chapter_9">
    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
    <h3>What is The Right Price?</h3>
<p>In the past, we suggested that the amount you should spend on a bat is dependent on the number of games and the level of competition at which you play. The more you play, the more you can justify a more expensive bat.</p>
    <h4>How Much Should you Spend?</h4>
<p>While that follows logic, the more we test bats and see the insignificance of their differences in performance, we don’t think this theory is the most accurate. Instead, the amount you spend should be a function of what you have, how much you value the bat, and how willing you are to find a deal.</p>

<p>If we had to create a statistical regression, it would show that you should spend what it takes to get any bat you want on the market if you bought your truck new in the last three years. If your truck is ten years or older, find a used bat.</p>

<p>Everyone else in between?</p>

<p>Ask your spouse.</p>

<p>Our point here, really, is that we can’t tell you how much you should spend on your bat. It’s your money. You do you.</p>

<p>We think any budget can get the proper preferred performance for any hitter as long as you’re willing to be diligent and patient enough. If you’re not, then pull out your wallet, and let’s get on with your lives.</p>

<p>For the rest of us, here are some tricks to the bat buying trade.</p>
    <div class="border-bottom border-success py-2"></div>
    <h2>Don’t Ever Believe There is a Must-Have Bat</h2>
<p>Another pitfall we see that costs more than a few more than a few is when people buy into the must-buy a certain bat mentality. We’ve been tracking this business for a long time and, save the pre-tooled 2017 DeMarini CF Zen in a drop 10 2 3/4 USSSA, there has NEVER been a must-buy bat. NEVER.</p>

<p>(The pre-tooled, by the way, was eventually made illegal).</p>

<p>If you find yourself looking on the secondary market to pay more than MSRP for a bat, you can be perfectly sure you have been duped. Some might froth at the mouth hearing us explain this out loud. But we stand by it. No Voodoo One, The Goods, Blue Meta, Z-Core Redline, or Z1000 has EVER actually performed as well as people have hyped.</p>

<p>We also hate the idea of resellers taking advantage of a kids game and we’ll never do anything to support them.</p>

<p>The bat market is too quickly cornered---and like stocks in a bull run, you can be sure there are many trying to plant mass hysteria in their social profiles and FB posts for bats they stocked in their trunk six months ago. Some folks tap into exploiting parental FOMO very well. After all, parents are the ones buying the bats.</p>

<p>We say never, ever, pay more than MSRP for a bat. And if there isn’t a warranty, then don’t even pay that.</p>
    <div class="border-bottom border-success py-2"></div>
    <h2>Does price matter?</h2>
<p>If we’re honest, for many, the answer might be no. And those who think the answer is yes aren’t wrong.</p>

<p>That’s a weird comment to make after just telling you not ever to pay more than MSRP. But stay with us for a second.</p>

<p>Consider this: For some of you, you just spent $1000 on a hotel room for four nights, $300 budgeted for food, $200 for gas and another $200 to $400 per kid for the tournament fee. You’re going to do this two to eight times from February to October. We’re talking, without exaggeration, a process that runs upwards of $5000-$10,000 in a given year.</p>

<p>It’s all fair and reasonable. This is life because it’s our vacation, our family time, and at least in our house, it’s just what we do.</p>

<p>Yet, somehow we’re still going to spend hours scouring the internet to save $50-200 on the one device that makes much of the above possible?</p>

<p>It’s not crazy to see the irrationality of the angst we suffer over the best deal possible when we’re talking about a small fraction of the total cost of this entire experience.</p>

<p>(Wilson Sporting Goods sponsored the above section).</p>

<p>The point here is that it’s perfectly reasonable to just buy the bat you want for the price a trusted retailer is offering it.</p>
    <div class="border-bottom border-success py-2"></div>
    <h2>MAP Deals</h2>
<p>As discussed in the glossary, legitimate vendors are required to keep their pricing on certain bats above a certain level for a certain amount of time. This is, like it or not, how the bat business goes around.</p>

<p>The reason Wilson Sporting Goods, as an example, is willing to invest tens of millions of dollars into a bat design and manufacturing process is because they know JustBats, for example, is willing to buy those bats in bulk.</p>

<p>And the reason JustBats is willing to buy those bats in bulk is because they know the manufacturer is going to enforce minimum pricing industry wide. JustBats can, therefore, count on a certain margin to help pay employees and keep the lights on.</p>

<p>No guaranteed pricing, no bulk orders. No bulk orders, no millions of dollars into production and design. No production and design, no innovation.</p>

<p>Of course, we all want a deal on a bat. But MAP is, in large measure, why the performance bat market is as interesting as it is. Buying a bat for a non discounted price, but not one red cent more, is a perfectly reasonable approach to buying bats.</p>

<p>To be sure, it also isn't a reason to pay full price when you can find a deal on a legit site. As well, waiting for bats to come off MAP is also a perfectly reasonable way to live life. But if you want your size at your specific time, you might not have a choice but to buy a bat when it's full price. You wouldn’t be the first.</p>

<p>Now, is the bat industry also a collaborative enterprise where bat companies are tacitly gouging the consumer through minimum pricing requirements? Well, we’d say it’s no more a racket than is any economic market where two or three manufacturers make up more than 90% of the goods. But, yada yada yada, for another day.</p>
    <div class="border-bottom border-success py-2"></div>
    <h2>Tricks of the Bat Deal Trade</h2>
<p>If you are still in for a bat deal after that (and who isn’t?), we think the art of the bat deal is where this gets fun---especially because you are coming to the table armed with a clear idea of precisely what your hitter needs. A bat deal is always a deal if you end up with the right bat (and you didn’t pay over MSRP).</p>

<p>Without exaggeration, we’ve bought more than 500 bats. We use most of them for testing and many of them for games our players and their teams participate.</p>

<p>The vast majority of these purchases are on secondary market sites like eBay, Sidelineswap and the Facebook Marketplace. However, we have bought several new-in-wrapper directly from every vendor you can name. And at times, we may or may not have acquired bats through deals in the parking lot of Walmart that made us wonder if this might be what it feels like to buy an ounce of coke.</p>

<p>That’s a roundabout way of saying, if there’s anything we feel qualified to speak on, it is buying fantastic bats on the cheap.</p>
    <h3>Buy Used on eBay/SidelineSwap/Facebook/Others</h3>
<p>Buying used might be the most obvious way to save hundreds of dollars on a high-end bat. Some shy away from used bats because they think they might be buying a lemon.</p>

<p>However, actual bat performance is remarkably consistent through the lifespan of most serious bats. That isn’t to say all secondary market buys are beautiful bats. Do not buy a bat with a missing end cap, significant dent, crack or from a disreputable seller. See if the reseller has a rating and do your diligence, no doubt.</p>

<p>But rattles, barrel scratches, torn grips, beat-up end caps and the likes prove the bat has been used. Weirdly, it's proof the bat works and works well. Ball marks are not indicative of a broken bat. But, no ball marks could mean the opposite.</p>

<p>Honestly, we have purchased hundreds of used bats over the years with few issues. One of our sons is currently hitting very well with a $50.00 eBay bat, so don’t stress too much if you aren’t looking to shell out $350.</p>

<p>We like Sidelineswap the best and eBay as our second choice. But both are similar. We are not fans of the FaceBook marketplaces because there seems to be too much negotiating and potential for a shady business (“DM me!!!”). However, we can see how some like the idea of ‘knowing’ the person they are buying from and Facebook gives more opportunity for that.</p>
    <h3>Buy Old/Last Year</h3>
<p>Another simple way to save a few bucks is to buy last year’s model of the bat. This year’s version is quite often always the same as last year’s version. We think our reviews directly on batdigest.com track this well, so check there for the actual differences.</p>

<p>Some bats haven’t changed for several years and it is not uncommon to see the current year’s bat $100+ more than last year’s bat despite being the same bat save the paint job. That phenomenon started BatDigest in the first place (comparing two Combat Portent bats from 2014 and 2015).</p>

<p>If you’re worried about missing out on the latest and greatest, consider this. We tracked several college teams this year to determine what they were using. Almost the entire South Carolina NCAA Div 1 tournament baseball team used the 2013 and 2014 5150s. One of the best teams in the country was using bats that were more than five years old. In addition to that team, several other hitters at the College World Series showed up to the plate with well-aged Omahas.</p>

<p>If the glamour of taking off that wrapper doesn’t appeal to you and you’re perfectly fine, maybe even proud, of using a bat that wasn’t marketed in the last eight months, then last year’s bat might be the way to go.</p>

<i>Sizing Note: Don’t buy last year’s bat if it isn’t in the correct size. No amount of savings is worth having the wrong swing weight.</i></p>
    <h3>Buy in October</h3>
<p>Another lesser-known trick is to buy your bat in the offseason---especially if you're in the used market. October always treats us well and this is when we pick up many bats to test for the following year.</p>

<p>We haven’t tracked it scientifically, but our eyeball tests show that bats going for $100 in October of the previous year are going for $150 to $200 in the following February. Supply and demand are simple enough to predict and a bit of planning can save you some serious cash on some dynamite bats.</p>
    <h3>Buy New</h3>
<p>You might also just want to buy a new bat. There is nothing wrong with that and something we have done often. If that’s the route you choose to go, make sure you buy it from a certified retailer--because full price on a bat with no warranty isn’t worth it.</p>

    <h3>How to Buy the Best Bat</h3>
<p>When the rubber meets the road we think you'll have the knowledge from above to make the right decision.</p>

<p>Here is our 6 step process to follow.</p>
    <ol>
        <li aria-level="1">Consider only the bats legal in your league</li>
        <li aria-level="1">Narrow your bat options by swing weight.</li>
        <li aria-level="1">Narrow by bat type based on your preferences.</li>
        <li aria-level="1">If there are still a lot of bats in your pile, consider the exit speeds of those bats.</li>
        <li aria-level="1">Price out each of your options.</li>
        <li aria-level="1">Buy a bat.</li>
</ol>
    <h2>Example</h2>
<p>At the risk of taking the fun out of you deciding how those steps above might look, we have a case study example of how one might go about those 8 steps.</p>

<i>Situation: 13-Year-Old Boy who needs a new bat. He is going to BBCOR next year and currently plays in a USSSA league this year. His budget is anything under $400.</i></p>
    <h3><b class="book-term">Step 1 - Leauge</b></h3>
<p>USSSA.</p>

<p>Bat Left: After narrowing bats by USSSA, there are roughly 150 options left.</p>
    <h3><b class="book-term">Step 2 - Swing Weights</b></h3>
<p>We need to find a way to find the right swing weight. This player is sizing up from a 31/21 and although he’s grown a lot, bumping to a drop 5 will be a battle.</p>

<p>At this point in the process, we find most parents get distracted by the model type instead of, what they should care about, the swing weight. The trick, if you want to be an expert bat buyer, is to keep your eye on the prize: an appropriatley sized bat. At this point in the process, the model is irrelevant.</p>

<p>If you can get to a cage or try some bats out that would be helpful. Again, we can't stress enough, pay all your attention to the size and swing weight of the bat instead of the model. But if you can't get to the cage, then you'll need to find someway to have your player try some bats of different sizes.</p>

<p>After some testing and bat borrwing and maybe a trip to the field or two, let’s say our example kid does really well with 32/24s that fit into the balanced category.</p>

<p>That's great. Now we can narrow our bat choices by USSSA bats that are balanced and that come in the size of 32/24.</p>

<p>A quick count on Dicks Sporting Goods shows there are no more than 10 that fit that description.</p>

<p>Now we are finally getting somewhere.</p>
    <h3><b class="book-term">Step 3 - Bat Type Preferences</b></h3>
<p>Ater studying the general differences in the six major bat types, this hitter (or his parents) decide that a two piece composite ticks most of the boxes of his preferences.</p>

<p>Specifically, he wants a big barrel, balanced swing and, although he doesn't mind hand sting, is okay that the bat will feel good and give great feedback.</p>

<p>Removing the hybrid and single piece bats from his list we are left with 5 different USSSA 32/24 in a two piece composite that have a balanced swing.</p>
    <h3><b class="book-term">Step 4 - Multiple Bats Left - POP</b></h3>
<p>At the time of this writing, from Justbats.com and DickssportingGoods.com, we find these big barreled bats that fit our needs above:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>DeMarini CF</li>
        <li>Slugger Meta</li>
        <li>CAT 9 Composite</li>
        <li>Easton ADV 360</li>
        <li>Axe Avenge Pro</li>
</ul></p>
<p>With 5 left, now we can consider exit speed and performance ratings.</p>

<p>The trouble with exit speed and performance ratings is, as we state above, most reviews struggle to realize the difference between feel and real. The average user review on a vendors site has no sense there is a difference betwee the two to start with.</p>

<p>But, with 5 bats left in our pile, we can look for some clues as to any performance advantages---realizing full well there likely isn't any.</p>

<p>Our personal best judge is the exit speed ratings on our site. We use multiple hitters on multiple pitches and rotate through bats well enough that we feel the data is honest.</p>

<p>You'd find, from our data, that all those bats do very well among our hitters and that the CF and META did the best.</p>

<p>We would not fault you for disregarding those. At this point in the process, with those five bats left, we are straining at gnats. If there is a particular fondness for Marucci, a love the Axe handle or a nostalgia for Easton then you'd be just fine going with those others.</p>

<p>But in our little example, let's narrow down to the CF and the META based on our best scientific sense of the true exit speeds which, we readily admit, might not be more 1 or 2 mph on a good day with the wind at our backs.</p>
    <h3><b class="book-term">Step 5 - Price</b></h3>
<p>If you are looking for new, then at the time of this writing, both bats, new-in-wrapper from certified vendors, are $349. We checked a few sites and it looks like both bats are still under MAP pricing.</p>

<p>If you want some older modles, at the time of this writing, we found a 2017 Demarini CF in a 32/24 going for a measly $1,200. That isn’t a typo. People are crazy. Under no circumstance will you buy that bat.</p>

<p>But we do find both a 2021 CF and META 32/24 for a buy it now price of 229.86. These are coming from the same seller.</p>
    <h3><b class="book-term">Step 6 - Buy a Bat</b></h3>
<p>The moment of truth.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that, at this point, the differences between the Meta and CF in a drop 8 are negligible at best. The reason it’s a hard choice is that you’re buying a name and paint job as much as anything else.</p>

<p>You sincerely cannot go wrong here.</p>

<p>If it were us, we’d buy both used bats for the $230 each, see which one we liked better, and then sell the other or keep it as a backup. However, if you’re staying true to your $400 budget, then flip a coin.</p>

<p>That's our case example. As you likely sensed, there isn't a perfect path to the perfect bat. But, when we narrow our choices by league, swing weight and a bat type based on our preferences, we can often quickly narrow down to a few reasonable options.</p>

<p>Buying the right bat is a game of elimination. When we know the league swing weight we need, much of the confusion is elimiated and we're often left with a clear path of two or three bats. In most of those cases, either bat will work just fine and it's now a matter of gathering enough gumption to make a decision and move on with our lives.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
    <h3>A Final Word</h3>
    <p>In 2017, a few months before the USA bat standard was put into effect, Bat Digest was interviewed by the New York Times for an article on what the changing bat standard meant to the industry at large. The article got a crazy amount of traction and the final line in the article quotes Brian Duryea saying, in effect, a “$400 bat can’t fix $4 swing” and how there is “no substitute for good, old-fashioned practice.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>

    <p>That stands as true today as it did back then. The right swing can make any bat look terrible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>None of that is to say the bat doesn’t matter, even if a lot of people read it like that in the Times article. Indeed, the right bat matters, a lot.

    <p>But what it is saying is that producing and finding the right bat isn’t as difficult as many would have us believe, and a lot of our consternation over the matter is likely unfounded. Our best bat isn’t hidden in some pit of snakes, tucked away on a shelf in Diagon Alley, or waiting for some unremarkable kid to pull it from a rock and turn into a home run hitter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No, the right bat is close by for no other reason than the range of possible swing weights is limited and the certification in which you play creates a governing standard that many companies can meet.

    <p>That is to say, and we hope you’re sitting down for this, the best bat doesn’t exist because there’s no such thing as THE best bat. That becomes readily apparent, and we hope at least mildly liberating, when we accept that our best bat includes all those models that meet a specific set of preferences that include, chief among them, a particular swing weight and feel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>

    <p>Thinking there is such a thing as the best bat is the tail wagging the dog. The bat doesn’t make you the best. Rather, you make your bat best.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>

    <p>If we had a chance to be interviewed by the Times again we’d point out how finding the right bat for the right time is still difficult. If USA bats set out to make things more obvious then it didn’t work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>

    <p>We would also show how the consolidation of bat companies since 2018 has moved bat marketing into a real smash and grab. That is, smash a home run and then grab the consumer’s money. We’d show how bat marketing, now almost entirely depending on the algorithm of social media, has encouraged and magnified the bat industry’s dependence on sensationalism—not an ounce of which helps the consumer make informed decisions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although that commentary most likely wouldn’t have been the final word in the Times article, this might have: your best bat isn’t the one someone else can hit the farthest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>

    <p>In that kernel of wisdom, we’re hopeful those who were willing to climb aboard this train of reason and deliverance can find the wherewithal to band together and do the only thing we can to fight the onslaught of bat hype: vote with our wallets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>

    <p>At the risk of being too cliche, we affirm that knowledge is power–power at the plate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You know your hitter. You now know bats.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>

    <p>Happy hunting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>

    <p>Brian &amp; Jon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
